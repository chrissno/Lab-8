<p>Alan Lomax (1915–2002) was one of the great ethnomusicologists and field collectors of folk music of the twentieth century, recording thousands of songs throughout the United States and Europe. This map displays his travels through the American South through Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Virginia to record the little-known southern backcountry and blues music that we consider uniquely American.</p>
